Ballintober, County Roscommon, is 6 kilometers from the town of Castlerea. It contains a reasonably well preserved remains of a stone castle first mentioned in writing in 1311. It is not recorded who built the castle, but the builders may either be the Normans, or the O'Conor family who ruled Connaught at various times during the last two millennia. It is said that King Cathal O'Connor called for an abbey to be built at Ballintubber. However, his workers built the abbey at Ballintubber, Co. Roscommon and not Ballintubber, County Mayo. When O'Connor discovered this, he ordered that a greater and grander abbey be built in the correct Ballintubber, located in Co. Mayo." }},
